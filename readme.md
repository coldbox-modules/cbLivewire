[![cbwire CI](https://github.com/coldbox-modules/cbwire/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=development)](https://github.com/coldbox-modules/cbwire/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

cbwire is a ColdBox module that makes building reactive, dynamic, and modern interfaces delightfully easy without leaving the comfort of CFML.

## Short Pitch

Build reactive apps easily using CFML and less JavaScript! ðŸŽ‰

## Longer Pitch

Building modern CFML apps is complicated. ColdBox makes creating server-side apps easy, but what about the client-side? Front-end JavaScript frameworks like Vue and React are powerful, yet they also introduce complexity and a significant learning curve when creating our apps.

What if you could create apps that look and feel like your Vue and React web apps but are written with CFML. Impossible, you say? Nay, we say!

Introducing **cbwire**: Power-up your CFML!

* ColdBox 6+
