## Short Pitch

Build reactive apps easily using CFML and way less JavaScript! ðŸŽ‰

## Longer Pitch

Building modern CFML apps has become a bit complicated. ColdBox makes server-side programming a cinch, but what about our front-end development? Front-end frameworks such as Vue and React have transformed our apps and are undoubtedly powerful. Still, theyâ€™ve also introduced some complexity and added a significant learning curve when creating web applications.

What if you could create applications that look and feel just like your Vue or React web apps but written primarily with CFML. Impossible, you say? Nay, we say!

Introducing **cbwire**: Power-up your CFML!

* Adobe CF 2018+ or Lucee 5+
* ColdBox 6+

## Credits

cbwire wouldn't even exist if it wasn't for the impressive efforts of **Caleb Porzio** ( creator of Livewire, also Alpine.js ) and the PHP Laravel community. 

Caleb created Livewire for use with a popular PHP MVC framework. cbwire is a port of the Livewire functionality to ColdBox and CFML, with some additional goodies sprinkled in.

The cbwire module for ColdBox is written and maintained by [Grant Copley](https://twitter.com/grantcopley), [Luis Majano](https://twitter.com/lmajano), and [Ortus Solutions](https://www.ortussolutions.com/).
